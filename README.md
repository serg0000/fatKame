# Kame (FatKame)

Hi!

This is a fork of the miniKame, I'll use it to extend the functionality of my adaptation to the body of the robot.

# Goals:

- Offer a robot body which fits a 2s lipo, cheaper servos, a 6A BEC, a ultrasonic sensor, and that has an access chute for the battery 
- Have the functions separated into Controller-Processor-Executor
- Have a WebController which serves a simple page and gets called by ajax calls from this webpage for the robot actions
- Use the ultrasonic sensor for very simple "Spatzenhirn" autonomous mode where the bot avoids bumping into stuff

For details on the bot, please take a look at the [splendid original miniKame](https://github.com/bqlabs/miniKame).
